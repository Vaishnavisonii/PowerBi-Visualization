## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the company Adventure Works to draw the sales data for different categories of bikes for 2023. 
We can infer that the lowest selling bike was Frestyle Master, its total sales was 1800. In Freestyle Master the product category is Freestyle Master 2000 as inferred from the chart.

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Add a slicer for the product category, on the Home tab, select Slicer.
- Step 3 : Drag the Product Category field from the Fields pane to the slicer visual. This will create an interactive filter based on product categories.
- Step 4 : Repeat the process to create another slicer, this time for the Payment Method field.
- Step 5 : For each slicer, add a title by selecting the Format tab and choosing Title from the options.
- Step 6 : Drag the positioning of the slicers to the right side of the report area.
- Step 7 : Add a stacked column chart to your report. From the Fields pane, drag the Order Total onto the Y-Axis, Product Size onto the X-Axis, and Product Category onto the Legend.  
- Step 8 : Set the chart title to Order Total by Product Size and Product Category for 2023.
- Step 9 : Drag the stacked column chart visual to the left side of the Report area (next to the interactive slicer filters).
- Step 10 : Add a donut chart for Order Total Share by Product Category and set the chart title to Order Total Share by Product Category for 2023 and drag the donut chart visual below the stacked column chart created previously.
- Step 11 : Add a table showing all product names with their corresponding order totals.
